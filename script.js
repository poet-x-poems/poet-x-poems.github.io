This is where I live
as well as my family
Often annoying

Necessary friend
Reminds me when I need it
Almost smashed again

I prepared for this
I know that I will do well
Lost information

Really is gorgeous
Allows productivity
Missing most software
    `,

Building new ideas
I spend all my time on this
Failing to compile

Just skipped studying
I hope I answer correct
Good luck, please arrive

My thoughts of pursuing my dream were sealed,
not unlike the water in a big bottle.
At first the bottle was overflowing,
my hope and aspirations active.

                           Slowly it drained,
              as if the bottle sprung a leak.
I shut the lid,
in an effort to conserve the water.
It was supposedly a success,
     although a large sacrifice was required.
It may have been beneficial at the time,
                 but it was a terrible trade.

With the lid shut closed,
and ideas long locked in,
   I do not know when I will open them again.

The
sound of
the leaves
rustling as the
breeze passes by. The
bright, vivid colors which
will soon turn brown and fall. The
leaves are starting
to wither as summer
is coming to an end. I look
at the tree again, only to see
myself in the past. The calming green
leaves are becoming scarce. As I think back
to when the
leaves were
still green, I
take myself
back to
elementary school,
middle school.
Now I am in
high school.

I’m sorry for taking
the last position,
The very last one.
I know you have
wanted the position
for a very very long time.

I got lucky and
my application
came through faster.

I think you should
apply        again
next          year.

I won’t be
your competition
because
I won’t go again.
    `,
    `
The icy silence I hear,
with nothing left all night long.
I carry your heart from the earth,
yet in these thoughts
I might sell your love for peace.
I hope you don’t mind,
if I carry your heart with me.

In disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,
I love you as one loves obscure things.

Even as I speak,
I don’t know any more ways to love.

      I all alone rise and sink,
  I shall love thee better after death.

I’d wake and hear the cold splintering,
               breaking.
          I said, I love you.
           You said, nothing.
